Your goal is to identify core technical competencies within course descriptions.\n\n\nTask\nExtract all significant technical concepts, tools, methodologies, and programming languages mentioned or strongly implied in the provided Course Description.\n\n\nConstraints\n\nOutput MUST be a valid JSON list of strings (e.g., [“Python”, “Linear Regression”]).\nDO NOT limit the count; extract as many as are relevant, but avoid generic words like “assignment,” “student,” or “learning.”\nUse “Title Case” for all concepts.\nNO conversational filler. NO markdown code blocks (```json). Just the raw list.\nIf a concept is a specific tool (e.g., “Pandas”, “Docker”), prioritize it.\n\n\nExample Output\n[“Data Wrangling”, “Tidyverse”, “Functional Programming”, “API Integration”, “Python”]"
