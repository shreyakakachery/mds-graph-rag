# MDS Knowledge Map: GraphRAG Edition 

An automated system to map the MDS curriculum using a local GraphRAG pipeline.

## Project Overview
This project builds upon my previous [MDS Knowledge Map](https://github.com/shreyakakachery/mds-knowledge-map) by replacing manual concept tagging with an automated AI pipeline. I extract technical concepts from course descriptions, with the use of a local LLM, to visualize the hidden prerequisites and knowledge flow across the program.
